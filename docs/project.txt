project: clone reddit place
frontend: javascript client (minimal) with actioncable framework
backend: ruby on rails 5 with actioncable for websockets
database: redis for pub/sub

The board must be 1000 tiles by 1000 tiles so it feels very large.
Each tile can be painted 1 of 16 colors
All clients must be kept in sync with the same view of the current board state, otherwise users with different versions of the board will have difficulty collaborating.
We should support at least 100,000 simultaneous users.
Users can place one tile every 5 minutes, so we must support an average update rate of 100,000 tiles per 5 minutes (333 updates/s).
The configuration must be flexible in case there are unexpected bottlenecks or failures. This means that board size and tile cooldown should be adjustable on the fly in case data sizes are too large or update rates are too high.

installed ubuntu windows
then rvm
sourced the init for rvm
then created the project

user accesses the app
backend responds to request by delivering javascript for subscription
the user downloads the javascript, runs it, then subscribes
every user is a publisher too, and there's a single channel for the board data

we'll use redis for pub/sub
